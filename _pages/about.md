I am an early career scientist interested in thinking across macroscopic and microscopic scales to understand how trophic interactions shape community ecology. I am interested in food webs and symbioses as models to explore these topics. <br><br>
By pairing field-based approaches and in situ manipulations with laboratory experiments I can selectively poke and prod communities of microorganisms, host-microbe interactions, and trophic complexity to understand basic features of ecological networks  and function across diverse environments.
