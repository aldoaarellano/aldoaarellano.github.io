I am currently a PhD Candidate in Microbiology at the University of Wisconsin-Madison interested in thinking across macroscopic and microscopic scales to understand how trophic interactions shape community ecology. I am interested in food webs and symbioses as models to explore these topics. <br><br>
By pairing field-based approaches and in situ manipulations with laboratory experiments I can selectively poke and prod communities of microorganisms, host-microbe interactions, and trophic complexity to understand basic features of ecological networks and function across diverse environments. <br><br>
My experience in research began in limnology and aquatic ecology, where I studied the spatio-temporal dynamics of seasonal cyanobacteria blooms. From then I caught the "research bug" and moved on to work in marine microbial ecology where I began to understand the importance of a systems-level perspective for understanding the emergent properties of ecosystems. Most recently, I use a novel mosquito model (<i>Wyeomyia smithii</i>) to elucidate basic features of host-microbe-environment interactions. I am also interested in the role of microorganisms in the evolution of diverse host life histories and how microbial symbionts may impact host resilience and phenotypic plasticity.
